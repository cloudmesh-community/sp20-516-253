#### Introduction

Cloud is an off-premise form of computing. It accumulates data on the Internet. Cloud services are run by general cloud servers. Cloud-based resources need to be housed in data centers.

Data center and cloud, both can serve as the storage of a large amount of data. Fundamnetal differences between a data center and a cloud storage are below:

Cloud:

    Cloud is an off-premise form of computing.
    Cloud resources will be shared with the other users of the same provider, if the private cloud is not used.
    t accumulates data on the Internet.
    Cloud services are run by general cloud servers.
    Cloud-based resources need to be housed in data centers.

Data Center:

    A data center is an on-premise hardware.
    Data center is a fully secured program without the intrusion of any third party.
    It accumulates data within the local network of an organization.
    Data centers are run by in-house technological departments.
    Data center has the capacity of storing servers.

A typical data center is fully redundant with power, power backup, cooling solutions, safety devices and individual personnel to maintain and manage the infrastructure. It has limited capacity and can only be increased by purchasing and installing hardware equipment. Businesses using a third-party data center can have huge savings on power costs and are saved from purchasing the expensive infrastructure

### Customizable vs. scalable

A data center is ideal for companies that need a dedicated system that gives them full control over not only their data but the hardware itself. Because only the company is using this hardware infrastructure, a data center is more suited for an organization that has to run many types of applications and complex workloads.

A data center, however, has limited capacity. You're responsible for purchasing and installing more equipment and the latest technology if your company needs to expand the storage and workload of the data center.

A cloud data system has potentially unlimited capacity, based on your vendor's offerings and service plans. The disadvantage is that you do not have as much control over the remotely located hardware, since the cloud vendor owns and manages the data center system. Furthermore, unless you pay to have a private cloud within the vendor's network, your company will be sharing hardware resources with other cloud users.

### Security

With a cloud vendor, your company will be entrusting its data to a third party. It's up to the cloud provider to ensure it has the most up-to-date security certifications. If your cloud resides on several data centers in different locations, each location will need the proper security measures.

Your cloud data can be accessed by anyone with the proper credentials from anywhere with an internet connection. This is convenient, but it also opens a wide array of access points, all of which need to be protected to ensure that data transmitted through them is secure.

A data center is physically connected to your company's local network. This makes it easier to ensure that only people with company-approved credentials and devices can access stored apps and information. You are responsible for your own security, though.

### Costs

Obviously, if your company builds a data center from the ground up, this will take a lot of time, and your company will be responsible for the system's maintenance and administration. Operating a large data center can cost a company $10 million to $25 million per year.

A cloud service is by far more cost-effective, especially for small companies. It does not require anywhere as much time or money to set up and run. The cloud service is available for your company's use almost immediately upon registration. As your company's data needs change over time, the cloud vendor should be able to scale your service up or down quickly. Most companies have a range of subscription plans to account for this.

As we have seen more of a difference between cloud and data center- it would be better to know about cloud vendors and with the below points we can say that it’s not about choosing the best cloud providers, rather it’s about choosing the best-suited cloud provider as per your needs. Let us deep dive an gather more details.

### Google Cloud
Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which is offered by Google, is a suite of Cloud Computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products such as Google Search engine, YouTube, and more.

Google Cloud Platform began its journey in 2011, and in less than a decade it has managed to create a good presence in the cloud industry. The initial intent of Google Cloud was to strengthen Google’s own products such as Google Search engine and YouTube. But now, they have also introduced their enterprise services so that anyone can use Google Cloud Platform which shares the same infrastructure as that of Google Search or YouTube.

### Amazon Web Services

Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of amazon.com, which provides an on-demand Cloud Computing platform to individuals, companies, and governments on a paid-subscription basis.

Amazon Web Services is the oldest and the most experienced player in the cloud market. As one of the oldest cloud providers, it has established a bigger user base, as well as bigger trust and reliability factors.


### Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure, initially called Azure, was launched in 2010 with the intent to provide a competent Cloud Computing platform for businesses. Azure was renamed as ‘Microsoft Azure’ in 2014, though the name ‘Azure’ is still commonly used. Since its inception, Microsoft Azure has shown a great progress among its competitors. 


### Market Share

AWS as Pioneer in cloud is leading with around 30 percent of public cloud share in its name. Microsoft Azure is on the second place, owning around 16 percent of the worldwide market share. Google, on the third place, owns up to 10 percent of the market share worldwide.

Even though AWS has an added advantage of being the first one of its kind, Azure and GCP also have their own set of strengths. Using Azure cloud makes more sense to several organizations that use MS tools since it’s easy to integrate MS tools with Azure cloud. And, GCP offering the best pricing model for the infrastructure, on which Google Search engine and YouTube run, is the only reason customers need to go for GCP
